# PyToExeConverter

Converts .py file to .exe using cx_Freeze package internally.  

A build folder will be created in the same location of .py file containing the executable file.  

This is not a very useful script, it just saves a few steps and you don't need to create setup.py and build it manually.  

<b>Note:</b> You need to download <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cx_Freeze/#files">cx_Freeze</a> and install it for this script to work.
